# SPSV Licensing & Compliance Analytics Dashboard

This project analyses licensing and compliance activity within the Small Public Service Vehicle (SPSV) sector in Ireland using synthetic data.

The project demonstrates a full data analytics pipeline including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning, and dashboard visualisation.

## Data
All datasets used in this project are synthetic. They were generated to follow the structure and schema of real-world SPSV datasets while avoiding the use of restricted or sensitive data.

## Project Components
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and aggregation
- Machine learning for risk prediction
- Interactive Power BI dashboard for visualisation

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard presents:
- An executive overview of licensing and compliance trends
- A detailed analysis of complaints, inspections, and enforcement actions
- A predictive risk section based on machine learning outputs

## Repository Structure
- `data/` – raw, cleaned, and feature-level datasets
- `notebooks/` – Python notebooks

## To Note
This project was completed for academic purposes. Predictive outputs are intended to demonstrate methodology rather than real-world enforcement decisions.
